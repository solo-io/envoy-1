bug_fixes:
- area: router
  change: |
    Fix a timing issue when upstream requests are empty when decoding data and send local reply when that happends. This is
    controlled by ``envoy_reloadable_features_send_local_reply_when_no_buffer_and_upstream_request``.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Applied 2 QUICHE patches for crash bugs in ``QuicSpdyStream`` ``OnDataAvailable()`` and ``OnInitialHeaderComplete()``.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Fixed crash bug when QUIC downstream stream was read closed and then timed out.
- area: decompression
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where Envoy will go into an endless loop when using the brotli decompressor. If the input stream has
    redundant data, the decompressor will loop forever.
- area: websocket
  change: |
    Only 101 is considered a successful response for websocket handshake for HTTP/1.1, and Envoy as a proxy will proxy the response
    header from upstream to downstream and then close the request if other status is received. This behavior can be
    reverted by ``envoy_reloadable_features_check_switch_protocol_websocket_handshake``.
- area: async http client
  change: |
    Added one option to disable the response body buffering for mirror request. Also introduced a 32MB cap for the response
    buffer, which can be changed by the runtime flag ``http.async_response_buffer_limit`` based on the product needs.

removed_config_or_runtime:
# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`

new_features:
- area: google_grpc
  change: |
    Fixed recursion when HTTP connection is disconnected due to a high number of premature resets.
- area: grpc
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in gRPC async client cache which intermittently causes CPU spikes due to busy loop in timer expiration.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where Datadog spans tagged as errors would not have the appropriate error property set.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where child spans produced by the Datadog tracer would have an incorrect operation name.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug that caused the Datadog tracing extension to drop traces that
    should be kept on account of an extracted sampling decision.
- area: proxy protocol
  change: |
    fixed a crash when Envoy is configured for PROXY protocol on both a listener and cluster, and the listener receives
    a PROXY protocol header with address type LOCAL (typically used for health checks).
- area: proxy_protocol
  change: |
    Fix crash due to uncaught exception when the operating system does not support an address type (such as IPv6) that is
    received in a proxy protocol header. Connections will instead be dropped/reset.
- area: proxy_protocol
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where TLVs with non utf8 characters were inserted as protobuf values into filter metadata circumventing
    ext_authz checks when ``failure_mode_allow`` is set to ``true``.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fix crash due to uncaught exception when the operating system does not support an address type (such as IPv6) that is
    received in an mTLS client cert IP SAN. These SANs will be ignored. This applies only when using formatter
    ``%DOWNSTREAM_PEER_IP_SAN%``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed crash when HTTP request idle and per try timeouts occurs within backoff interval.
- area: url matching
  change: |
    Fixed excessive CPU utilization when using regex URL template matcher.

removed_config_or_runtime:
# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`

new_features:
- area: tap
  change: |
    added :ref:`custom_sink <envoy_v3_api_field_config.tap.v3.OutputSink.custom_sink>` type to enable writing tap data
    out to a custom sink extension.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    added %RESPONSE_FLAGS_LONG% substitution string, that will output a pascal case string representing the resonse flags.
    The output response flags will correspond with %RESPONSE_FLAGS%, only with a long textual string representation.
- area: config
  change: |
    Added the capability to defer broadcasting of certain cluster (CDS, EDS) to
    worker threads from the main thread. This optimization can save significant
    amount of memory in cases where there are (1) a large number of workers and
    (2) a large amount of config, most of which is unused. This capability is
    guarded by :ref:`enable_deferred_cluster_creation
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.ClusterManager.enable_deferred_cluster_creation>`.
- area: extension_discovery_service
  change: |
    added ECDS support for :ref:` downstream network filters<envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Filter.config_discovery>`.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    added
    :ref:`disable_immediate_response <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.disable_immediate_response>`
    config API to ignore the
    :ref:`immediate_response <envoy_v3_api_field_service.ext_proc.v3.ProcessingResponse.immediate_response>`
    message from the external processing server.
- area: http
  change: |
    added :ref:`Json-To-Metadata filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.json_to_metadata.v3.JsonToMetadata>`.
- area: extension_discovery_service
  change: |
    added metric listener.listener_stat.network_extension_config_missing to track closed connections due to missing config.
- area: redis
  change: |
    added support for time command (returns a local response).
- area: redis
  change: |
    Provide initial span attributes to a sampler used in the OpenTelemetry tracer.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    implemented
    :ref:`request_attributes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.request_attributes>`
    and
    :ref:`response_attributes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.response_attributes>`
    config APIs to enable sending and receiving attributes from/to the external processing server.

deprecated:
    Added an off-by-default runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.google_grpc_disable_tls_13`` to disable TLSv1.3
    usage by gRPC SDK for ``google_grpc`` services.
